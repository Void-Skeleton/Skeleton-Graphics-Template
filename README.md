# Skeleton-Graphics-Template
Skeleton Graphics Template, VERSION Alpha 0.1.0
This is an engine of graphics developement. The comments are written by Chinese so you probably can't understand that. I'll try to translate into English in VERSION Alpha 0.1.1, and refactory the code in VERSION 0.2.0.
Thanks for http://www.rupeng.com which I have learnt Java.
Thanks for Java Package javax.swing and java.awt, the authors of the package packaged the methods well, or I can't do it so easy.
